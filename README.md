When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This is a command line application that will generate a new README.md file based on inputs given from the user. This project was created in order to quickly create this professional README.md file, to learn how to use node.js, and different packages such as inquirer.
